# Taxi Company Revenue Optimization: Payment Type Analysis

## Project Overview
The overall scope of the project is to investigate methods to increase revenue for a hypothetical taxi company based in New York. This task focused on conducting an A/B test to determine whether there is a relationship between payment type and the average fare amount paid per taxi rider.

## Analysis and Evaluation
The A/B test results indicated that riders who pay with credit cards, on average, have larger total fare amounts compared to those who pay with cash.

## Conclusion
Based on the findings, the next step is to explore strategies to incentivize riders to use credit cards over cash. Potential approaches include partnerships, points programs, or educating riders on the benefits of paying with credit cards.
